While working on this project via [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), I learned/practiced some of the important JavaScript & HTML concepts:

- `for of`
- `import` / `export`
- Radio & checkbox inputs
- `querySelector`
- `getElementsByClassName`
- `classList.remove`
- `includes()`
- `filter()`
